Title: Duet

Lyrics:

Do you feel left behind?
Like there's something not right?
I don't think I've been connected
But of all the dead volcanos on Earth you just happened to retch
And roll
Through mine

There were fistfuls of hair 'round the foot of my chair
And echoes of screams before me
But breathing out I swear you were real

You were there
You were there 
You were there
For a while

But I don't know what's real and what's going on
And I don't wanna be here when the sky is gone
(I just can't keep up with it, I)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired
(Nothing's good, there's something more)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired

It was somewhere to wink
It was slipped in my drink
A necropolis for the taking
But all the cities fall into war and there's nothing but knives
and fears
and forks

Seems the more I find out, the more I'm sure of it girl
And baby I get the feeling, there's somewhere darkened over it
And it's here (I feel it coming, one, one step from nothin')
And it's here (I feel it coming, one, one step from nothin')
And it's here for a while (I feel it coming, one, one step from nothin')
(I-I, I-I)

But I don't know what's real and what's going on
And I don't wanna be here when the sky is gone
(I just can't keep up with it, I)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired
(Nothing's good, there's something more)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired

But I can hear them plunderin' the streets at night
You never shoulda told them what you had inside
And I don't want my children in an endless race
And I don't wanna wait to see what else they take
(So far I'm in love with you, I'm)
And all that matters now is that we don't let go
(And I can tell they're watching for it)
And you can be my wonder in my town of woe
(Time to let the genie out)
If it's gonna happen let it happen now
If it's gonna happen let it happen now!
